## üßÆ Simulate selling your Apple stocks at a target price

1. In the **`Sell/Select Multiple Holdings`** form in the app.
2. Enter:
   - **Ticker:** e.g. `AAPL`
   - **Date of sale:** this can be **today** or any future date.
   - **Target sale price:** e.g. `250.0`.
     - If you don‚Äôt specify a price, the app will use the **vested price or purchase price** by default to calculate gains.

3. The **currency rate (‚Ç¨/$)** will be automatically fetched for that date.

4. Review the results to see:
   - Your gross proceeds
   - Estimated tax due (acquisition gains, capital gains and social contributions...)
   - Net cash you would receive after taxes

This helps you plan your sales strategy or anticipate your future tax bill.

If you want to **reset the simulation**, simply click on **`Rollback`**.

This will restore your holdings and calculations to their original state, letting you start a new scenario from scratch.

‚úÖ Tip: You can repeat this with different target prices or dates to see **what‚Äëif scenarios** and pick the best timing.
